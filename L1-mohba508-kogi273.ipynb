    "There are currently two versions of Python in common use, Python 2 and Python 3, which are not 100% compatible. Python 2 is slowly being phased out but has a large enough install base to still be relevant. This course uses the more modern Python 3 but while searching for help online it is not uncommon to find help for Python 2. Especially older posts on sources such as Stack Exchange might refer to Python 2 as simply \"Python\". This should not cause any serious problems but keep it in mind whenever googling. With regards to this lab, the largest differences are how `print` works and the best practice recommendations for string formatting."

    "\n",
    "[Note: If you have been programming in a language such as C or Java, you might be a bit confused about the term \"define\". Different languages use different terms when creating variables, such as \"define\", \"declare\", \"initialize\", etc. with slightly different meanings. In statically typed languages such as C or Java, declaring a variable creates a name connected to a container which can contain data of a specific type, but does not put a value in that container. Initialization is then the act of putting an initial value in such a container. Defining a variable is often used as a synonym to declaring a variable in statically typed languages but as Python is dynamically typed, i.e. variables can contain values of any type, there is no need to declare variables before initializing them. Thus, defining a variable in python entails simply assigning a value to a new name, at which point the variable is both declared and initialized. This works exactly as in R.]"
